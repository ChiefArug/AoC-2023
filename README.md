### My solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)

Note that inputs are **not included** in this repo, if you want to actually run my solutions (and seriously, 
why would you) then you need to get the inputs from the official website and add them to the root directory 
named like `day1.txt` for each day. These are automatically ignored by the `.gitignore`.
